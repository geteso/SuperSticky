#### Description
On the esoBB forum software, the sticky label remains at the top of the conversations view until it has been read by a user that's signed in, and then it will gradually fall according to last reply date.  Stickied conversations are organized by last reply date or creation date if there is no reply.  The 'super sticky' label remains above stickied conversations until it has been read and will then behave in a similar manner to the sticky label.
